# Objective: Build and train a basic autoencoder using the MNIST dataset

#### *Model Architecture *

Implement an encoder that compresses a 28×28 grayscale image into a smaller
latent representation.Implement a decoder that reconstructs the original image from this latent space.

#### *Model Training*

Train the autoencoder on the MNIST training dataset and Evaluate its performance using the test dataset.

#### *Model Evaluation and Visualization*

Plot the training and validation loss curves and Show a side-by-side comparison of original vs reconstructed images from the test set.
